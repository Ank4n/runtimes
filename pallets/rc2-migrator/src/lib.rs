//! The operational pallet for the Relay Chain, designed to manage and facilitate the migration of
//! the parachain registrar, HRMP and the accounts holding their deposits from the Relay Chain to
//! the Coretime chain. This pallet works alongside its counterpart, `pallet_ct_migrator`, which
//! handles migration processes on the Coretime chain side.
//!
//! This pallet is responsible for controlling the initiation, progression, and completion of the
//! migration process, including managing its various stages and transferring the necessary data.
//! The pallet directly accesses the storage of other pallets for read/write operations while
//! maintaining compatibility with their existing APIs.
//!
//! Every `TODO(ahm-v2)` here and in `pallet-ct-migrator` is work this migration needs before it
//! runs for real. Go through all of them before release.
//!
//! This pallet follows `pallet_rc_migrator` (removed in polkadot-fellows/runtimes#1016, readable at
//! <https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/tree/985df25829b3385730ff66acc50161ac57f0692c/pallets/rc-migrator>).
